# Exos

Set of javascript exercises inspired by https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings.

For each exercise, you are given one JS script that contains an error (either at compile time or run time), your goal is to fix them all.

You need to have `node` and `npm` installed.
Clone this repository and run `npm install` inside to get the needed dependencies.
Then, open the cloned repo in your favorite text editor and finally run one of the following commands:

## Watch mode

Run `npm start` to start watching for changes in your exercises. Edit them in your text editor and once you feel you're done with one of them, remove the `// I AM NOT DONE` line from it to move onto the next task.

## Filtered mode

Run `npm start [string]` to only watch for the exercises which title match the passed string.

## Hints

Run `npm start hint [exercise]` to display hints for the given exercise.
