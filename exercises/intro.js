// I AM NOT DONE

// - Open your browser at http://localhost:1234
// - Open the dev tools console on that page and make it big
// - Fix the current exercise's code ! (check the page title to know which one)

// N.B: If your code compiles without errors, **it does not mean that it's working**:
// Make sure you also do not have any errors shown in your dev tools' console before moving onto the next exercise.
// Sometimes, the page will not refresh automatically, so you'll have to do it manually.

// Only the dom exercises will display something on the browser web page,
// the others only act on the console inputs and output, the webpage in itself will only change color
// to indicate wether the exercise is done (green) or not (red).

// If you're having any trouble, read all the error messages carefully, in your browser and in your text editor
// they might contain information that will help you solve your problem.
// Otherwise, type `hint` in your dev tools' console so show some tips.
// Also, every exercise section contains a `README.md` file that points you to relevant sections of the Mozilla Developper Network documentation, reading them is recommended.

// When you are finished with an exercise, remove the "I AM NOT DONE" comment
// from the current file to automatically move onto the next exercise
